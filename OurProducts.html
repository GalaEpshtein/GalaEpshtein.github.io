<pink>PINK</pink>
<p> This lemonade is a staple of lemonade mix-ins. We got the strawberrys from a farm in arlington called "Biringer Farms". The farm also offers u-pick(which we did, just not for the strawberrys), and it is very cool and fun. I would recommend going. Anyways, this lemonade costs ONE DOLLAR.</p>
